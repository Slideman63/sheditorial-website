                <p>I have spent my career in ELT, initially as a teacher and Director of Studies, and latterly in Editorial roles in ELT
                    publishing. I have worked for 10 years in each of these fields, and I enjoy drawing on my experience in both when
                    working on new materials, in order to make them as interesting, engaging and effective as possible, for students and
                    teachers alike.</p>

            UK. I taught children from age 5 to 16, adults from levels A1 – C2, including Exam Preparation classes and 1:1.</p>

                    <p>As Director of Studies, I had overall responsibility for the Academic side of the school. My role included assessing
                    each client’s needs, matching them with the appropriate tutors, and creating an overall timetable each week which made
                    sure that each client’s needs were fully met. I also recruited and supported teachers in delivering the bespoke classes
                    that clients needed.</p>

                    <p>I wrote the five Lesson Plan Packs which formed the basis of all lessons taught across the centres. Each level (Junior,
                    Pre-Intermediate, Intermediate, Upper Intermediate, Advanced) comprised three weeks of lessons covering Grammar,
                    Reading/Listening, Vocabulary, Speaking, and Writing/Fluency.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also recruited and gave induction training to around 150 teachers each summer across 14 centres, as well as visiting
                    the centres and observing an supporting teachers as the courses were running.</p>
